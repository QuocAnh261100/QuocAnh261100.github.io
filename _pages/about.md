Hi, thanks for visiting! My name is Quoc-Anh. You can call me Andrew! 

I am currently an AI Researcher at [FPT Software AI Center](https://www.facebook.com/aic.fsoft/). Previously, I was an AI Resident at [FPT AI Residency](https://wp.fpt-aic.com/ai-residency/), a leading ML/AI research program for undergraduate in Vietnam. Under the guidance of [Dr. Hung Tran-The](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=um-FS-gAAAAJ&hl=en), I focused on Bayesian Optimization (BO) and spent 2 enriching years in the program. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics and Information from [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.vn/en/) with thesis focuses on using BO in Mixed Search Space under supervision of [Prof. Nguyen Thi Ngoc Anh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x-H87vsAAAAJ&hl=en). I also hold a Master's degree in Applied Mathematics at [Mathematics Institute, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology](http://math.ac.vn/en/trang-chu/gioi-thieu-vien-toan.html). I was fortunate to be supervised by [Dr. Hoang Duc Luu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GEt6qKUAAAAJ&hl=en). My master thesis focuses on solving ODEs with complex attractors by using NeuralODE and Continuous Normalizing Flow.

From September 2025, I will pursue a PhD Program at [Probabilistic Machine Learning Group](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/), [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en) under supervision of [Prof. Samuel Kaski](https://kaski-lab.com/).
