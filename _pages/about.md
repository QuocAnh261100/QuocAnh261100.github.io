Hi, thanks for visiting! My name is Quoc-Anh. You can call me Andrew! 

I‚Äôm currently an AI Researcher at [FPT Software AI Center](https://www.facebook.com/aic.fsoft/). Before that, I spent two enriching years as an AI Resident at [FPT AI Residency](https://wp.fpt-aic.com/ai-residency/), one of Vietnam‚Äôs leading machine learning research programs for undergraduates. During this time, I worked under the guidance of [Dr. Hung Tran-The](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=um-FS-gAAAAJ&hl=en), with a focus on Bayesian Optimization (BO).

I hold a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Applied Mathematics and Information from [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.vn/en/), where I completed my thesis on BO in Mixed Search Spaces, supervised by [Prof. Nguyen Thi Ngoc Anh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x-H87vsAAAAJ&hl=en). I also earned a Master‚Äôs degree in Applied Mathematics from the [Mathematics Institute, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology](http://math.ac.vn/en/trang-chu/gioi-thieu-vien-toan.html), where I was fortunate to be supervised by [Dr. Hoang Duc Luu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GEt6qKUAAAAJ&hl=en). My Master‚Äôs thesis explored solving ODEs with complex attractors using NeuralODE and Continuous Normalizing Flow.

Starting in September 2025, I will begin my PhD at the [Probabilistic Machine Learning Group](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/) at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en), under the supervision of [Prof. Samuel Kaski](https://kaski-lab.com/).
