Hi, thanks for visiting! My name is Quoc-Anh.

I am an [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc) PhD student in the [Probabilistic Machine Learning Group](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/) at Aalto University, where I have the privilege of being supervised by [Professor Samuel Kaski](https://kaski-lab.com/). Through the ELLIS program, I am also fortunate to be co-supervised by [Dr. Desi Ivanova](https://desirivanova.com/) from the University of Oxford. My research focuses on Bayesian decision-making under uncertainty.

Previously, I was an AI Researcher at [FPT Software AI Center](https://fptsoftware.com/services/digital-technologies-and-platforms/artificial-intelligence). Before that, I spent two enriching years as an AI Resident at [FPT AI Residency](https://web.facebook.com/aic.fsoft/?_rdc=1&_rdr#), one of Vietnam‚Äôs leading machine learning research programs for undergraduates. During this time, I worked under the guidance of [Dr. Hung Tran-The](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=um-FS-gAAAAJ&hl=en), with a focus on Bayesian Optimization (BO).

I hold a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Applied Mathematics and Information from [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.vn/en/), where I completed my thesis on BO in Mixed Search Spaces, supervised by [Prof. Nguyen Thi Ngoc Anh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x-H87vsAAAAJ&hl=en). I also earned a Master‚Äôs degree in Applied Mathematics from the [Mathematics Institute, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology](http://math.ac.vn/en/trang-chu/gioi-thieu-vien-toan.html), where I was fortunate to be supervised by [Dr. Hoang Duc Luu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GEt6qKUAAAAJ&hl=en). My Master‚Äôs thesis explored solving ODEs with complex attractors using NeuralODE and Continuous Normalizing Flow.
